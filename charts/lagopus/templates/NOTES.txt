Lagopus is accessible in two ways:

- Web interface: http://{{ (split "/" .Values.lagopusIP)._0 }}:80
- REST API: http://{{ (split "/" .Values.lagopusIP)._0 }}:80/api

If you visit that API endpoint in the browser you should see the API docs.

General documentation is at:
https://docs.lagopus.io/

If you are encountering issues, please report them at:
https://github.com/qlyoung/lagopus/issues

You can view the server logs like so:

   kubectl logs lagopus-server --container lagopus-server

---
Troubleshooting:

When you installed this chart, you --set a value for lagopusIP. That value
should have had the form:

   a.b.c.d/32

If it didn't, the above section that tells you how to access Lagopus probably
won't work and you should uninstall the chart and install it again using that
form. Unfortunately you can't just provide an IP since the underlying thing
used to make the web interface accessible wants a range of addresses (a
prefix). I usually just pass a /32 to give it a range with only 1 address in
it. If for some reason you want to use an address pool, you can, but in that
case MetalLB will select one address from that pool and you'll need to get that
IP from kubectl, since I can't read the k8s API from this document in order to
tell you :)

To manually find the IP:

   kubectl get service lagopus-server

It's the one under "EXTERNAL-IP". If it says "<pending>" something is screwed
up, try reinstalling the chart using --set lagopusIP=a.b.c.d/32 as described
above. If that doesn't work open an issue.
